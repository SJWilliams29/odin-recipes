            </li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>6 skinless chicken breasts, cut into small chunks</li>
            <li>415g can refried beans</li>
            <li>198g can sweetcorn, drained</li>
            <li>700ml bottle passata</li>
            <li>1tsp golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>10 tortillas</li>
            <li>2 x 142ml pots soured cream</li>
            <li>200g cheddar, grated</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in your largest pan, then fry the onions,
                peppers, chopped chilli and coriander stalks with half the
                garlic for 10 mins until soft. Stir in 2 tsp ground coriander
                and 2 tsp cumin seeds, then fry for 1 min more. Meanwhile, in
                another frying pan, fry the chicken in the remaining oil, in
                batches, until browned - add it to the pan of veg as it is done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the beans, sweetcorn, coriander leaves and 150ml of the
                passata into the veg and chicken. In a bowl, mix the rest of the
                passata with the other crushed garlic clove, the remaining
                spices and the sugar, then set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, lay the tortillas onto a board and divide the
                chicken mixture between them, folding over the ends and rolling
                up to seal. Divide the passata sauce into the dishes you are
                using, then top with the enchiladas. Dot over the soured cream,
                sprinkle with grated cheese and scatter with the sliced chilli.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cool and freeze (see freezing tips, below) or, if eating
                straight away, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6, then bake for
                30 mins, scattering with more coriander leaves to serve, if you
                like.
