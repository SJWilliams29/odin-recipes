        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken breasts, trimmed and cut in 2-3cm cubes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>40g piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>6 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>5 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1/2-1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
            <li>cooked rice and steamed broccoli, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Tip the chicken into a bowl, sprinkle over the flour and some
                seasoning and toss until the chicken is evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the ginger, garlic, soy, honey and half the lemon juice
                in a bowl. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok over a high
                heat and fry the chicken for 3-4 mins until lightly golden. Tip
                in the honey sauce and stir-fry for 10 mins, or until the
                chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced enough to
                coat the back of a spoon. Taste for seasoning and squeeze over
                the remaining lemon juice, if needed, then serve with rice and
                steamed broccoli, if you like.
            </li>
